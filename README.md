I used ans.equals("Y") and ans.equals("N") to determine whether the variable ans has string value of Y or N or not base on which the decision will be made

i used Math.random()*100+1 to generate numbers from 1 to 100
 Math.random() is used to generate numbers b/w 0 to 1 so i multiplied those with 100 and added 1
